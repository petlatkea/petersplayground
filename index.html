        <h1>This is my playground &hellip;</h1>
        <p><b>Peter's Playground</b> isn't really a game &ndash; it is more like all of the components for a game. Think of it a bit like <i>Garry's Mod</i>, sort of an engine, sort of a collection of components and effects that could be combined into a game!</p>

        <p>My plan is to create a 2D tile based game <i>(engine)</i>, and this is the playground for testing and developing all the parts for that.</p>

        <p>Every level tests or illustrates one (or a few) specific features, and while I'm constantly improving on the game, I try to keep the earlier stuff simple, so you'll see that NPCs are extremely primitive in the early levels, and get more and more features later on.<br> You can skip to any level, by clicking its' name below:</p>

        <ol class="levels">

                <div class="levelinfo">A simple guard moves back and forth in front of a key-card, that you need to exit the level.</div>
                <div class="leveldetail">
                    <p>
                        Apart from everything basic with tiles and movement, collisions and exit, I wanted to make tiles that weren't entirely unwalkable, thus the thin walls, and I wanted doors that would keep you from moving through when they were closed.</p>

                        While it might look like a maze, it is just a room with a lot of walls, and the guard runs a fixed pattern, exactly the same as before. I spent more work creating better looking wall-tiles for all the connected walls.</p>

                    <p>
                        I wanted an enemy that could "see" where you are, and turn in any direction. The sentry can see through walls, but the bullets can't move through them. The interesting thing is that the sentry doesn't really have a cone of sight, it calculated the angle between it and the player, and if the current rotation is the same (+/-5), it fires a shot. Took me longer to figure delayed shots, than the angle-calculation.</p>

                        The earlier patroller moved in a fixed pattern, no matter what the map suggested. This one has fix-points (nodes) at every intersection, where a choice can be made. Every time a traveller comes to an intersection, it chooses a random direction (but not the one it came from, unless that is the only option).<br> The enemies require a nodegraph of the map, and so far, it has to be constructed manually.</p>

                <div class="levelinfo">Still a maze, but with doors in some corridors</div>
                <div class="leveldetail">
                    <p>
                        I discovered that enemies went through doors perfectly, so wanted to make a maze, where you could outrun an enemy, if it had to wait for doors to open. Also the enemy is a more intelligent Hunter - it has a simple statemachine, where it is either searching or hunting. When searching it moves randomly, like the traveller, but at every intersection, it scans its' surroundings, and if it detects the player, plans a route to him, and changes into hunting-mode. When hunting it simplt follows the planned route. It cannot see the player, and don't know how to hurt him. It was mainly the routeplanning I wanted this level to demonstrate.</p>

            <li>
                <div class="levelname">Better Guard</div>
                <div class="levelinfo">A Guard guards a keycard, but he can see the player, and attacks if to close</div>
                <div class="leveldetail">
                    <p>
                        Rather than improving the Hunter, I decided to make the Guard from the first level, a bit more intelligent. He can now see the player (in a view-cone ahead of him). He can't see through walls, so if he has spotted the player, and the player hides behind a wall, he tries to move a bit back and forth, before giving up.<br> The main feature is the line-of-sight expanded into a viewcone, and all characters now have a canSee(other) method they can call. The hardest thing was making the guard <em>not</em> move himself, so the player would be out-of-sight. The Guard2 has a larger statemachine than the Hunter: Either he switches between Walking and Turning, until he spots the player, then he goes Watching, where he rotates and moves, always keeping the player in sight. If the player gets close, he goes into Attack-mode, where he tries to electrocute the player (still without moving away from his post, though). If the player disappears from sight, the guard goes into Wondering-state, where he moves, rotates and waits randomly, before giving up, and goes back to Walking and Turning (unless he spots the player).

                    <p>To make interactive tiles, I needed a method for checking if a tile was entered or left by an object, and whether is was free of all objects.<br> The light-up tile is just that - it lights up when anyone steps on it, and turns of when everyone leaves. The guard is just there to have someone else moving.<br> I also wanted some one-directional tiles, and used the same level for testing those.

                    <p>To test and provoke scrolling of the screen, I made a map that was larger than the canvas (and shrunk the canvas at the same time).<br> Implementing scrolling is extremely simple - it isn't scrolling per se, but more like moving a camera around. And it is done purely by changing the regX and regY of the stage.</p>
